      <h3>Pet Training</h3>
      <p>Cats can be trained, but not as thoroughly as dogs. It requires a lot of patience and consistent practice to get past their willful nature. With cats, it's best to focus training on establishing boundaries.When it comes to house training, cats have the advantage over dogs. Cats use the litter box instinctively. It may only take showing them where the box is one time. If a cat is slow to catch on to using the litter box or appears to forget later on, this is often a sign of an underlying health issue, and you should consult your veterinarian.Dogs, on the other hand, can be a lot tougher to potty train, especially puppies. Teaching them where it is and isn't acceptable to go usually takes a lot of repetition and positive reinforcement.</p>
